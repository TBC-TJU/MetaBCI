# MetaBCI

## Welcome! 
MetaBCI is an open-source platform for non-invasive brain computer interface. The project of MetaBCI is led by Prof. Minpeng Xu from Tianjin University, China. MetaBCI has 3 main parts:
* brainda: for importing dataset, pre-processing EEG data and implementing EEG decoding algorithms.
* brainflow: a high speed EEG online data processing framework.
* brainstim: a simple and efficient BCI experiment paradigms design module. 

This is the first release of MetaBCI, our team will continue to maintain the repository. If you need the handbook of this repository, please contact us by sending email to TBC_TJU_2022@163.com with the following information:
* Name of your teamleader
* Name of your university(or organization)

We will send you a copy of the handbook as soon as we receive your information.

## What are we doing?

### The problem

* BCI datasets come in different formats and standards
* It's tedious to figure out the details of the data
* Lack of python implementations of modern decoding algorithms
* It's not an easy thing to perform BCI experiments especially for the online ones.

If someone new to the BCI wants to do some interesting research, most of their time would be spent on preprocessing the data, reproducing the algorithm in the paper, and also find it difficult to bring the algorithms into BCI experiments.

### The solution

The Meta-BCI will:

* Allow users to load the data easily without knowing the details
* Provide flexible hook functions to control the preprocessing flow
* Provide the latest decoding algorithms
* Provide the experiment UI for different paradigms (e.g. MI, P300 and SSVEP)
* Provide the online data acquiring pipeline.
* Allow users to bring their pre-trained models to the online decoding pipeline.

The goal of the Meta-BCI is to make researchers focus on improving their own BCI algorithms and performing their experiments without wasting too much time on preliminary preparations.

## Features

* Improvements to MOABB APIs
   - add hook functions to control the preprocessing flow more easily
   - use joblib to accelerate the data loading
   - add proxy options for network connection issues
   - add more information in the meta of data
